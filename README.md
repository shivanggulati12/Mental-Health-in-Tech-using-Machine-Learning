# Mental-Health-in-Tech-using-Machine-Learning
The project aims to leverage the historical dataset to build machine learning models that predict the likelihood of tech professionals seeking treatment for mental health issues based on various factors such as age, gender, country, family history, work interference, etc.

This project aims to support ABC Corp in adopting a preventive approach to mental health care for their employees. A machine learning model has been developed to predict the likelihood of tech professionals seeking treatment for mental health issues based on a historical dataset.
Data and Statistical Questions
The dataset includes individual responses from employees in the tech industry, detailing their mental health status and whether they have sought treatment.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis were performed to understand the data better and to ensure it was suitable for building a predictive model.
Methodology
• Feature Pre-processing: Categorical and numerical features have been encoded appropriately for model input.
• Pipeline Preprocessing: Custom pipelines were created for different data types to automate the data preparation process.
• Model Selection: Various models including Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were trained and compared.
Installation

The project relies on several Python libraries listed as follows: - pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn


This project is associated with the BAIT 509 course, which is included in the MBAN program at the UBC Sauder School of Business.
